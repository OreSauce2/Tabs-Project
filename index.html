              <h3>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck</h3>
              People often say the key to confidence and success in life is to
              simply “not give a fuck.” Indeed, we often refer to the strongest,
              most admirable people we know in terms of their lack of fucks
              given. 
              <br> <br>
              Like “Oh, look at Susie working weekends again, she doesn’t
              give a fuck.” Or “Did you hear that Tom called the company
              president an asshole and still got a raise anyway? Holy shit, that
              dude does not give a fuck.” Or “Jason got up and ended his date
              with Cindy after 20 minutes. He said he wasn’t going to listen to
              her bullshit anymore. Man, that guy does not give a fuck.” 
              <br> <br>
              Chances
              are you know somebody in your life who, at one time or another,
              did not give a fuck and went on to accomplish amazing feats.
              Perhaps there was a time in your life where you simply did not
              give a fuck and excelled to some extraordinary heights.
              <br> <br>
              I know for
              myself, quitting my day job in finance after only six weeks and
              telling my boss that I was going to start selling dating advice
              online ranks pretty high up there in my own “didn’t give a fuck”
              hall of fame. Same with deciding to sell most of my possessions
              and move to South America. Fucks given? None. Just went and did
              it.

              <h3>Guide to Personal Values</h3>
              or the last few years, I’ve had an idea for a satirical self-help
              article called, “The Productivity Secrets of Adolf Hitler.” The
              article would feature all the popular self-help tropes—goals,
              visualizations, morning routines—except expressed through the
              exploits of Hitler.

              <br />
              <br />

              “Hitler starts his day at 5 AM each morning with a quick round of
              yoga and five minutes of journaling. With these strategies, he’s
              able to focus his mind on his highly ambitious goals.” “Hitler
              discovered his life purpose in a beer hall in his 20s and has
              since followed it relentlessly, thus infusing his life with
              passion and inspiring millions of others like himself.”

              <br />
              <br />
              “Adolf is a strict vegetarian, and makes sure to find time in his
              busy schedule of genocide and world domination to explore his
              creative side: he sets aside a few hours each week to listen to
              opera and paint his favorite landscapes.” I know that I would find
              the article hilarious. But that’s because I’m a sick, twisted
              fuck. But in the end, I’ve never quite worked up the courage to
              write the thing, for clear and obvious reasons.

              <br />
              <br />
              I’ve been doing this long enough to know that a) a bunch of people
              would get offended and devote themselves entirely to ruining my
              week with annoying emails and social media screeds, b) the satire
              would go over a bunch of people’s heads and they’d think that I
              was actually a Nazi, and c) some awful publication somewhere would
              run the headline, “Bestselling author outs himself as alt-right
              neo-Nazi” or some shit and my career would be over.

              <h3>The One Rule for Life</h3>
              Depending on your perspective, Immanuel Kant was either the most
              boring person on the planet or a productivity hacker’s wet dream.
              For over 40 years, he woke up every morning at 5:00 AM and wrote
              for exactly three hours. He would then lecture at the same
              university for exactly four hours. He followed that up with lunch
              at the same restaurant each day. Then, in the afternoon, he would
              go on an extended walk through the same park, on the same route,
              leaving and returning home at the exact same time. Every day.
              <br />
              <br />
              Kant spent his entire life in Königsberg, Prussia. I mean that
              literally. He never left the city. Despite the sea being an hour
              away, he never saw it.1
              <br />
              <br />
              Kant was efficiency personified. He was so mechanical in his
              habits that his neighbors joked they could tune their clocks based
              on when he left his apartment each day. He would leave for his
              daily walk at 3:30 PM, have dinner with the same friend every
              evening, and return home to finish work and go to bed at exactly
              10:00 PM.
              <br />
              <br />
              It’s easy for us to scoff at a guy like this. What a dweeb.
              Seriously, get a life, dude.
              <br />
              <br />
              But Kant was one of the most important and influential thinkers in
              modern history. He did more to steer the world from his
              single-room apartment in Prussia than most kings and armies ever
              did before and since.2
